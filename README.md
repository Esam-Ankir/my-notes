In this note i be talking about twenty advice for the **fundamentals of a good developer mindset**:

1. A single purpose of all software: To help people.

2. Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.

3. Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer and Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them.

4. A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.

5. Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.

6. It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.

7. Consistency is a big part of simplicity

8. The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.

9. Solving Problems steps: understanding,planning then dividing

10. Start small, improve it, then extend.

11. Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.

12. Stop Reinventing

13. As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’.

14. Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks.

15. Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.

16. Everything takes longer than you think.

17. Refactoring should be the first option.

18. The real purpose of comments is to explain “WHY” you did something, not “WHAT” the code is doing.

19. Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.

20. Know that every specific problem has its own specific solution.
